# The `EndoScalar` circuit: the effective scalar `a·λ + b`

Composition of `Kimchi.Gate.EndoScalar` rows into the full endo-scalar
decomposition. A challenge is processed 8 crumbs at a time, each row threading the
`(a,b,n)` accumulators; the result is the effective scalar `a·λ + b` and the raw
register `n`, which the wrapper asserts equals the input challenge.

Because each row is a `List.foldl` over its crumbs, chaining rows is just folding
over the concatenated crumb list (`List.foldl_append`) — the multi-row layout
adds nothing to the math.

## Main results

* `gate_toField` — a satisfying row from the canonical init `(a,b,n) = (2,2,0)`
  outputs the effective scalar `toField crumbs λ` and the register
  `nReconstruct crumbs`.
* `endoScalar_spec` — with the wrapper's `n = challenge`, that register IS the
  challenge: the gate computes the endo-decomposition of the challenge.
* `decomposeA_append` / `decomposeB_append` / `nReconstruct_append` — the
  row-threading (multi-row) composition, via `List.foldl_append`.
