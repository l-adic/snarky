# Phase 0: the Pasta-cycle axioms (STUB)

The foundation for a *faithful* (two-field) account of the kimchi scalar gates — see
`formal/docs/cycle-formalization.md`. The gate point-soundness lives over the
coordinate field `F` with `ℤ`-scalars (honest, already done); the SCALAR claims need
the curve's scalar field (the group order `q`), which differs from `F` on Pasta.

This file bundles the facts Mathlib cannot supply — the curve order (Schoof) and the
CM eigenvalue (`φ = [λ]`) — as fields of `CMCurve` / `TwoCycle`, so the gate theorems
can parametrize over them. Instantiating for Pallas/Vesta supplies these as `axiom`s
(checkable externally, NOT derivable in Mathlib). The fields flagged **AXIOM** are
the load-bearing ones; the rest is ordinary data.

Nothing here is used by the verified gate suite yet — it is the scaffold for Phase 1+.

    partner curve (whose scalar field is that field), i.e. the genuine top level for
