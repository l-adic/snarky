# The kimchi shape constants

Every structural dimension of the kimchi wire and batch, named at its production
origin. The names are **scoped notations expanding to the literals** — deliberately
not `def`s or `abbrev`s: the elaborated terms are the bare numerals, so bound
arithmetic (`omega`, `interval_cases`, `decide`) and every existing proof see exactly
the literals they need. Only the source names the dimension: the notations carry no
unexpander, so goals print the bare `7`s and `15`s. That is deliberate — the same
numeral serves several roles (`7` is `permCols` and `litRowCount`, `15` is `wCols`
and `coeffCols`), so any name a delaborator picked for a goal's `7` would be a guess,
and often the wrong one. Each
derived constant carries an `rfl` theorem machine-checking its derivation, so the
connection to the primitive constants is kernel-checked, not prose.

The primitives:

* `wCols = 15` — production `COLUMNS` (proof-systems `circuits/wires.rs`): the
  witness columns, and equally the per-gate coefficient cells.
* `permCols = 7` — production `PERMUTS` (`circuits/wires.rs`): the wired columns —
  seven wire pointers per row, seven σ polynomials, seven coset shifts.
* `selCount = 6` — the transcribed basic gate set (generic, poseidon, completeAdd,
  varBaseMul, endoMul, endoScalar). This is a SCOPE CHOICE of the formalization, not
  a production constant: production carries further selectors behind optional-gate
  flags, all declared deferrals here.
* `evalPts = 2` — the two evaluation points of every batch row, `(ζ, ζω)`.

The derived batch layout (`to_batch`, verifier.rs):

* `sigmaRows = permCols − 1 = 6` — the σ columns IN THE BATCH: production commits
  seven σ polynomials but batches only the first six (`sigma_comm[PERMUTS − 1]` is
  consumed by the linearization instead). Distinct from `selCount` even though both
  are `6`.
* `litRowCount = 1 + selCount = 7` — the literal single-column rows of the batch
  tail: the accumulator `z` plus the six selectors. Distinct from `permCols` even
  though both are `7` (and distinct from the Poseidon S-box exponent and the
  AddComplete constraint count, two further incidental sevens).
* `tailRowCount = litRowCount + wCols + coeffCols + sigmaRows = 43` — the batch rows
  after the public row and the ft row: `z`, the selectors, the witness columns, the
  coefficient columns, the six σ columns.
* `batchRows = 1 + tailRowCount = 44` — the abstract batch: the public row joins at
  chunking (its claims are proof-carried, bound through the opening), the ft row is
  consumed separately by the `_ft` terminals.

The flat segment stream of a run is `nc + 1 + tailRowCount · nc` segments: the
public row's `nc` chunks, the single-chunk ft row, then `nc` chunks per tail row.
