# The gate-argument primitive

The polynomial-lift interface a gate's constraints are read through. **Commitment-free**:
everything lives over an abstract field `[Field F]` with a primitive `n`-th root of unity
supplied as a hypothesis (`ω : F`, `hω : IsPrimitiveRoot ω n`, `0 < n`). No gate formula is
ever restated at this layer — a gate supplies its constraint family and reuses the one
evaluation bridge below.

## The `ArgumentEnv` / `Argument` pair

The per-gate interface mirrors kimchi's `argument.rs`:

* `ArgumentEnv R` is the cell environment a gate's constraints may read, anchored at a row —
  the current-row witness cells, the next-row witness cells (cyclic `i + 1`), and the
  current row's coefficient cells. It is the Lean counterpart of kimchi's `ArgumentEnv`
  restricted to the cell accessors (`witness_curr` / `witness_next` / `coeff`).
* `Argument F` is one gate's constraint family: a list of constraint expressions defined over
  every commutative `F`-algebra `R` from an `ArgumentEnv R`, together with its naturality
  square along `F`-algebra homomorphisms. It is the Lean counterpart of kimchi's `Argument`
  trait: `constraints` is `constraint_checks`, generic over the carrier the way
  `constraint_checks` is generic over `T : ExprOps` — kimchi runs the same code at `T = F`
  (direct row checks) and `T = E<F>` (the symbolic expressions compiled into the quotient),
  and `constraints_map` is the corresponding agreement between the two instantiations, which
  Rust gets for free by parametricity and Lean states as a proof obligation.

Genericity over `F`-algebras (rather than plain rings) is what absorbs gate **parameters**
(EndoMul's endomorphism constant, EndoScalar's interpolating-cubic coefficients): each becomes
the image under `algebraMap F R` of a fixed element of `F`, and the evaluation morphism is the
`F`-algebra hom `Polynomial.aeval (ω^i) : F[X] →ₐ[F] F`, which fixes those images.

The two carrier instantiations are packaged once, gate-independently: `rowEnv` (the field-level
cells of row `i`) and `polyEnv` (the column interpolants, with `shift` on the next-row side).
`Argument.bridge` — evaluation at a node carries `polyEnv` to `rowEnv` — is the one bridge
in the library; every per-gate bridge is that gate's `constraints_map` pasted onto it.

## Contents

* `ArgumentEnv`, `rowEnv`, `polyEnv` — the cell environment and its two carrier
  instantiations (field-level row cells, and column interpolants with `shift` on the

  carrying its polynomial-side constraints to the row-side ones.

## The VarBaseMul gate lift

The polynomial-algebra lift of kimchi's variable-base scalar-multiplication gate.
**Commitment-free**: everything lives over an abstract field `[Field F]` with a primitive
`n`-th root of unity supplied as a hypothesis (`ω : F`, `hω : IsPrimitiveRoot ω n`).

This is a **two-row** gate: a `VBSM` row `i` followed by a `ZERO` row `i+1`. Its cell map reads
*both* rows, so the poly witness needs the next-row shift (`Kimchi.shift`,
`Kimchi/Shifted.lean`) in addition to the column interpolants. The gate's field-level
constraint model (`Kimchi.Gate.VarBaseMul.constraints` / `Holds`) is **read-only** and reused
verbatim: no constraint formula is restated — the lift is naturality plus the shift.

`i + 1 : Fin n` is taken **cyclically**, needing `[NeZero n]`. A two-row gate is never placed
on the last domain row, so this agrees with the intended semantics on every occupied row.

## The EndoMul gate lift

The polynomial-algebra lift of kimchi's `EndoMul` (endomorphism-optimized
`VarBaseMul`) gate, following the cell-map and `Argument`-instance pattern of the CompleteAdd and
VarBaseMul gate lifts above. Like
`VarBaseMul` it is a **two-row** gate (a pair of `EVBSM` rows `i`, `i+1`), so the poly witness
reads the next-row outputs `xS, yS, n'` through the shift operator (`Kimchi/Shifted.lean`).

Two wrinkles over `VarBaseMul`:

* The gate's constraint list is parametrized by the base-field endomorphism coefficient
  `endo`; on the polynomial side this constant is `C endo`, and evaluation at any node returns
  `endo` (`eval_C`), so the same naturality argument goes through with the constant transported.
* The modeled gate is the **upstream-fixed** revision (12 constraints, with the distinct-point
  check `(xP - xR)·(xR - xS)·inv = 1`); its `inv` witness cell is not present in the pre-fix
  layout table; the fix reads it from current-row column 2 (`env.witness_curr(2)`).

The gate's field-level constraint model (`Kimchi.Gate.EndoMul.constraints`/`Holds`) is
**read-only** and reused verbatim; no formula is restated here.

**Modeling note (the `inv` cell).** The Lean gate models the upstream-fixed revision
(o1-labs/proof-systems@64129ce4), which adds the distinct-point constraint
`(xP - xR)(xR - xS) inv = 1` with an extra witness cell `inv`. That cell does not appear in the
pre-fix layout table, whose columns `2, 3` of the current row are free. We assign
`inv = cur 2`, verified against that commit. Faithfulness aside, the bridge
is naturality of `constraints` under evaluation and holds for *any* internally consistent column
assignment (the same `cellMap` defines both witnesses). The physical column matters only for
matching kimchi's concrete circuit table, which this commitment-free layer never pins.

## Column layout

An `EndoMul` block spans two `EVBSM` rows. Its inputs (`xT, yT, xP, yP, n`, the bits
`b1..b4`, the slopes `s1, s3`, and the intermediate point `xR, yR`) live on the current row
`i`; its outputs (`xS, yS` and the updated scalar `n'`) live on the next row `i+1`.

## The EndoScalar gate lift

The polynomial-algebra lift of kimchi's `EndoScalar` gate (the endomorphism-scalar recoder —
pure field arithmetic running Halo's Algorithm 2 over MSB-first 2-bit crumbs), packaged as a
`Kimchi.Lift.Argument` instance.

The gate's constraint list `Gate.EndoScalar.constraints` is defined over any commutative
`F`-algebra — its interpolating-cubic coefficients (`cPoly`/`dPoly`) enter through
`algebraMap F R` — so the instance is a direct read-through of the cell map; naturality is the
gate module's `Gate.EndoScalar.constraints_map`.

`EndoScalar` is a **single-row** gate: both `n0` (input) and `n8` (output) live on the same
row, so the cell map reads the current row only (the next-row and coefficient families are
unused). The cross-row chaining of the scalar register (`n0 ↔ n8`) is a copy-constraint
concern (the permutation layer), out of scope here.

## The Poseidon gate lift

The polynomial-algebra lift of kimchi's Poseidon gate, realized as a
`Kimchi.Lift.Argument` instance. Poseidon applies five permutation rounds per row
(15 constraints = 5 rounds × 3 state elements). It is a **two-row** gate with a **permuted**
register layout, and its round constants are its coefficient row: the next-row family supplies
the output state `s5`, and the coefficient family supplies the round constants `rc`. The MDS
entries are integer literals, so the gate's plain ring-hom naturality
(`Gate.Poseidon.constraints_map`) already carries the `F`-algebra naturality the instance
needs.

## The register layout

The layout (kimchi `poseidon.rs`, module-doc table l.9--13) is a genuine permutation:

|  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
| s0 | s0 | s0 | s4 | s4 | s4 | s1 | s1 | s1 | s2 | s2 | s2 | s3 | s3 | s3 |
| s5 | s5 | s5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
```

Note that `s4` is stored **before** `s1, s2, s3` in the register order; the output state `s5`
sits on the next row; the round constants `rc` come from the coefficient row (`rc()` l.212--217:
`coeffs[SPONGE_WIDTH * round + col]`, `SPONGE_WIDTH = 3`).

## Contents

* `cellMap` / `rcMap` — the permuted layout transcription (state cells / round constants).
* `rowWitness` / `rcRow` / `polyWitness` / `rcPoly` — their two carrier instantiations.
* `argument` — the Poseidon `Argument F` instance.

## The double generic gate's quotient lift

The polynomial lift of kimchi's **double** generic gate (`generic.rs`,
`CONSTRAINTS = 2`). Commitment-free, built directly on `Kimchi.Lift.Domain`.

The row-level gate predicate is `Kimchi.Gate.Generic.Holds` (defined in
`Kimchi/Gate/Generic.lean` — the double generic gate's two cell constraints); this
file owns only the *polynomial* side — the cell map into `Gate.Generic` and the
gate's `Argument` instance over column interpolants.

## Column layout (from `generic.rs`)

A generic row carries 15 witness cells `w : Fin wCols → F` and 15 coefficient cells
`q : Fin coeffCols → F`. The row packs **two** generic gates: the first uses registers
`w 0, w 1, w 2` with coefficients `q 0 … q 4`; the second uses `w 3, w 4, w 5`
with coefficients `q 5 … q 9` (`q 10 … q 14` are unused here).

Source: kimchi `generic.rs` (module doc + `constraint_checks`, l.245–250):

    * w0·c0 + w1·c1 + w2·c2 + w0·w1·c3 + c4
    * w3·c5 + w4·c6 + w5·c7 + w3·w4·c8 + c9

where the `cᵢ` are the coefficients (`q` here).

/-! ## The `Argument` instance

The generic gate plugs into the `Argument` primitive of `Kimchi.Lift` exactly like
the other five gates: the gate row `Gate.Generic R` is assembled from the current-row cells
(as `w`) and the coefficient cells (as `q`); the next-row family is unused (single-row). -/

coefficient cells `coeff` (→ `q`). -/

    Gate.Generic R :=
  ⟨coeff, cur⟩

/-- **Generic `Argument` instance.** The gate's constraint list `Gate.Generic.constraints`
read through `cellMap`; naturality is the gate module's `Generic.constraints_map` at
the underlying ring hom. -/
